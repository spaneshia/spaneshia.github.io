		<h2>by mankel daniel
		<h3>once upon a time there was this monkey named rory. everybody thout he did it on purpse.so they gave him some bananas as a reward
		<h3>woman 1:you are so smart rory
		<h3>rory:eee eee
		<h3>wel now rory was going around thinking he was some sort of monkey genius or something. and one day he heard his owner say-
		<h3>owner:my dang caris broke
		<h3>so rorys primitive raced to formulate a plan and here is what he eventually came up with
		<h3>rory mind:rory fix kar
		<h3>rory worked all day and all night and to make a long story short the end result was not a fixed car.
		<h3>owner: RORY!
		<h3>after it was all over rory has learned a very valuble lesson: rory is a mokey and monkeys dont fix cars.
